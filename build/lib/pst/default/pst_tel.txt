[telescope] ;-------------- define telescope

name:		define telescope name

weight:		telescope priority
		telescope with high priority (smaller weight number) will be assigned fields first.
		telescopes with the same weight number will be assigned fields at the same time.

lat:		telescope latitude

lon:		telescope longitude

alt:		telescope altitude, unit in meter

fovw:		telescope field of view in horizontal direction, unit in deg

fovh:		telescope field of view in elevation direction, unit in deg

exptime:	estimated time for telescope exposure per frame, unit in second

rottime:	estimated time for telescope overhat, unit in second

[pointings] ;-------------- network/pointings generation

scheduler:	telescope scheduler: 
		options:
		- [T]iling search, for wide FoV telescopes
		- [G]alaxy targeted search, for relatively small FoV telescopes
		- [A]utomatic selection, will be decided depends on telescope FoV

uarea:		for tiling search, some fields are expected to be skipped for several reasons. Here, $uarea defines a threshold on the tiling coverage, i.e. if part of the tiling is covered and the coverage is larger than $uarea, such tiling will be passed, otherwise, though part of tiling is covered, it would be still remained.
		apparently, $uarea can be only varied from 0 to 1
		if 0 set, any part of tiling is covered would be removed
		if 1 set, only tiling is 100 percent covered would be removed

cachemode:	cached mode for tilings generation:
		- 1. read tilings from $cachefile (if setted and exists), see if cashed tilings could also meet the area cuts (setted below), if everything works, read cached tilings and stored them into $cachefile, otherwise, clobber $cachefile, generate pointings (with default settings), and store to a new $cachefile
		- 2. the same as 1, but instead not store to a new $cachefile
		- 3. always generate tilings, clobber exiting $cachefile if any, and then store yields to a new $cachefile
		- 4. the same as 3, but instead not store to a new $cachefile

cachefile:	file name in which provides pre-defined tilings
		since, npz file would be used, if not .npz included in the suffix, a .npz will be put in the end
		leave blanket to skip

skipfile:	file name in which contains a coordinate list that would be skipped
		used to avoid: sources from some know catalog, e.g. bright stars, or, fields that had already been done, avoid duplication
		format: should be a npz file containing 4 lists: ra, dec, fovw, fovh (unit in deg)
		leave blanket if all tilings are acceptable

shift:		for tiling generation, the network was built with an initial FoV and then propagate to high ra,dec
		if $shift=0, use a focused tiling network with the initial FoV at 0,0
		if $shift>0, will optimise tiling network by a ramdom sampling on initial radec, in order to cover most trigger probs with the top $shift (a int number is needed) fields

limra:		tiling limitation on the Ra range

limdec:		tiling limitation on the Decl range

nfields:	in order to save time, set a number that will calculate visibility every a number of fields, only when trigger is not huge so that they are in the same portion of sky
		if not int given, will calculate visibility for each fields

limfields:	maximum number of fields that can be visited by telescope during night
		for telescope which has a limitation on time
		if not int given, will set no limitation on fields, Be careful when fields are too many

timelast:	force stop telescope when reaching a specific time
		the begining of time is setted below in $obstime
		unit in hours

ob:		OB mode for tiling search, in order to save overhat time
		e.g. 3,3, will generate an OB including 3 by 3 pointings inside
		use 1,1 without OB mode
		Be careful when OB is too big, since it would include also some low prob region by chance

[observe] ;------------- observation estimate

obstime:	define the start time for telescope schedule
		- 1. now
		start when receiving an alert
		- 2. night
		start from the beginning of the following night (defined by time when sun < $limsun)
		- 3. specific time in utc
		make sure to be readable by astropy.time
		e.g.1999-01-01T00:00:00.1234
		- 4. +/- x minutes
		some time before/later than now, e.g. -30, start 30 mins before, +30, start 30 mins later
		if not above given, will set to 1, i.e. start from now

order:		Ranking algorithms: 
		- 1. greedy algorithm: rank with priority 
		- 2. conservative algorithm: rank from west to east 
		- 3. optimal algorithm for 1, consider slewing angle
		- 4. optimal algorithm for 2, consider slewing angle

remcov:		remain only interesting fields, that cover high probs of priorization map
		a float num (0-1) should be given, e.g. 0.5, will remain fields that cover the top 50 percent probs of priorization
		if not float, would skip

remfields:	remain a number of fields
		an int number should be given, e.g. 1000, will remain the most interesting fields according to priorization
		if not int, would skip

limsun:		limitation on the sun altitude, for calculaing field visibility

limmoon:	limitation on the moon effect
		if a float/int number given, e.g. 30 (unit in deg), pointings within 30 deg to moon will be removed
		if auto is given, will skip pointing accoring to the lunar phase:
		moon light is calculated as a number between 0 to 100
		if moon light > 80, $limmoon = 30
		if moon light from 40 to 80, $limmoon = 20
		if moon light from 10 to 40, $limmoon = 10
		if moon light < 10, $limmoon = 1
		if not above given, will set to 30

limsobj:	limitation on the objects inside the solor system
		options: mercury,venus,moon,mars,jupiter,saturn,uranus,neptune
		multiple should be divided with comma

limsobjr:	limiting radius for solor object, unit in deg
		if not float, would skip solor removement

limalt:		limitation on airmass, avoid telescope being too low

[scheduler]  ;  ------------- scheduler setting

dither:	     	dithering: 
		give a number, e.g. 5 (unit in arcsec)
		only valid when repeat > 0

filter:		telescope filter
		in order to have color, put multiple divided by comma
		only valid when repeat > 0

repeat:		field repeatation:
		for dithering, or different filters etc
		0 for exposure once, 1 for twice, and so on

schfile:	name compostion for scheduler
		if a name given, e.g. pst_VST.txt, will remove and rebuild pst_VST.txt with yields
		if auto given, will set $schfile as {tel name}_{trigger name}_{date time}.txt
		leave blanket, will not generate schedule file

py2:		after schedule, excute $py2 python codes, for specific functions
		if muitiple, divided by comma
		leave blanket to skip
