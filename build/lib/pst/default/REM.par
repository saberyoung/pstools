[pointings] ;-------------- network/pointings generation

scheduler:	G
		;telescope scheduler: 
		; [T]iling search, for wide FoV telescopes
		; [G]alaxy targeted search, for relatively small FoV telescopes
		; [A]utomatic selection, will be decided as T or G,
		;    depends on telescope FoV and trigger size

uarea:		
		;when adding tilings, they will be skipped if 
		; a portion of its area is already covered or should be skipped
		; Here $uarea defines the threshold on the portion
		; if 0 set, any part of tiling is covered would be removed
		; if 1 set, only tiling is 100 percent covered would be removed
		; apparently, $uarea can be only varied from 0 to 1

cachemode:	
		;network mode:
		; 1. read fields from $cachefile if setted and exists, 
                ;    see if cached fields could meet the demandings setted below.
                ;    if yes, read and go on
		;    if no, clobber and rebuild $cachefile
                ;    if $cachefile not exists, generate pointings and store to a cachefile
		; 2. the same as 1, but instead, not store to a new $cachefile
		; 3. always, generate fields,
		;    clobber exiting $cachefile if any,
                ;    then store yields to a new $cachefile
		; 4. the same as 3, but instead, not store to a new $cachefile

cachefile:	
		;file name in which provides pre-defined pointings
		; since, npz file is used, so:
		; either put .npz in $cachefile, or without suffix
		; and I will put .npz in the end of $cachefile

skipfile:	
		;file name in which contains coordinate list that would be skipped
		; used to avoid:
		;   1. sources from some know catalog, e.g. bright stars
		;   2. fields had already been done, avoid duplication
		; format:
		;   should be a npz file, naming is same as $cachefile
		;   for $skipfile, should contain 4 lists,
		;   i.e. ra, dec, fovw, fovh (unit in deg) with the same lingth

shift:		
		;for tiling generation:
		; the network was built with initial tiling at ra=0, dec=0
		; if $shift>0
		;   optimise tiling network by a ramdom sampling on initial radec,
		;   in order to cover most probs with the top $shift fields
		; if $shift=0, use original tiling network

limra:		0,360
		;pointing limitation
		; on the Ra range

limdec:		-90,20
		;pointing limitation
		; on the Decl range

nfields:	5
		;in order to save time, calculate visibility 
		;   every some fields, if they are in the same portion of sky

limfields:	50
		;maximum number of fields that can be done diring night
		;for telescope which has a limitation on time
		; if leave blanket, or very large, e.g. 9999
		; scheduler will stop till time/pointing used up

timelast:	8
		;force stop when reaching a specific time
		; while the begining of time is setted in $obstime
		; unit in hours
		; if not set, use defaul, 24

[observe] ;------------- observation estimate

obstime:	night
		; define the start time for schedule
		;  [1] now
		;        start from now/when receiving alerts
		;  [2] night
		;        start from the beginning of the following night
		;        defined by time when sun < $limsun
		;  [3] specific time in utc
		;        make sure to be readable by astropy.time
		;        e.g.1999-01-01T00:00:00.1234
		;  [4] +/- x minutes
		;        some time before/later than now
		;        e.g. -30, 30 mins before
		;             +30, 30 mins later

order:		1
		; Ranking algorithms: 
		;  [1] greedy algorithm: rank with priority 
		;  [2] conservative algorithm: rank from west to east 
		;  [3] optimal algorithm: consider slewing angle, start from westest pointing 
		;  [4] optimal algorithm: consider slewing angle, start from highest ranking

remcov:		0.9
		; if a float num (0-1) given, 
		;   remain fields that cover $cov probs of priorization map
		;   decrease pointings would speed up following procedures
		; if not set, remain all fields

remfields:	200
		; if a number is given	
		;   remain the top $remfields fields
		;   decrease pointings would speed up following procedures
		; leave blanket will remain all fields

limsun:		-12
		; limitation on the sun altitude
		; will start scheduler when sun alt < $limsun

limmoon:	auto
		; limitation on the moon effect
		; give a number, e.g. 30 (unit in deg) or auto
		; if a number given: pointings within such radius will be removed
		; if auto given: do pointing removement accoring to the lunar phase:
		;  moon light is calculated as a number between 0 to 100
		;    moon light > 80, $limmoon = 30
		;    moon light from 40 to 80, $limmoon = 20
		;    moon light from 10 to 40, $limmoon = 10
		;    moon light < 10, $limmoon = 1

		; avoid objects inside the solor system
		; options: mercury,venus,moon,mars,jupiter,saturn,uranus,neptune
		; divided with comma

limsobjr:	2

		; pointings with such radius (unit in deg)
		;  includes solor objects will be removed

limalt:		2.0
		; limitation on height/airmass
		; avoid telescope being too low

[scheduler]  ;  ------------- scheduler setting

dither:	     	0
                ; dither mode
		; give a number, e.g. 5 (unit in arcsec)
		; or leave blanket

		;telescope filter 

repeat:		0
		;field repeatation:
		; for dithering, or different filters etc
		; 0 for exposure once, 1 for 2 exposures, ....

schfile:	pst_REM.txt
		; output name compostion for scheduler
		; if a name given, e.g. pst_VST.txt:
		;    will remove and rebuild $schfile
		; if leave blacket:
		;    will set $schfile as {tel name}_{trigger name}_{date time}.txt
		; if None, will not generate schedule file

ob:		
		;Use Observing Blocks for tiling search
		; in order to save time for suto focus, etc

py2:		
		; after schedule, excute $py2 python codes,
		;  for specific functions, e.g. interact with databse, 
		;    generate special OB files, etc.
		;  could be muitiple, divided by comma
