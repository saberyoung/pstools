[priorization] ;  ------------- what infos used for priorization 

trigger:	if include trigger infos into priorization if any

galaxy:		if include galaxy infos into priorization
		option:
		- 0. no galaxy infos
		- 1. galaxy mass/luminosity
		- 2. galaxy count

dist:		if include galaxy distance infos into priorization
		P_dist = gaussian PDF, which Gaussian was built with mean, var from trigger if any
		if True, works only when trigger = True and galaxy = 1 or 2

[react]  ;  ------------- for trigger search, when/how to response

telescope:	define which telescopes to be activated
		essential for auto search

action:		if just receive alert or activate also field scheduler
		- 1. only alert
		- 2. alert + telescope pointing scheduler

[data]  ;  ------------- define directory for putting data

dir:		define a directory to put yields, e.g. ./

py1:		after alert, excute $py1 python codes for specific tasks
		leave blanket to skip

[galaxies] ;  ------------- galaxy selection

cachemode:	cache mode for galaxy generation:
		- 1. read galaxies from $cachefile (if setted and exists), see if cashed galaxies could also meet the galaxy cuts (setted default), if everything works, read cached galaxies and stored them into $cachefile, otherwise, clobber $cachefile, query Vizier (with default settings), and store to a new $cachefile
		- 2. the same as 1, but instead not store to a new $cachefile
		- 3. always query Vizier, clobber exiting $cachefile if any, and then store yields to a new $cachefile
		- 4. the same as 3, but instead not store to a new $cachefile

cachefile:	file name in which provides pre-defined galaxies
		since, npz file would be used, if not .npz included in the suffix, a .npz will be put in the end
		leave blanket to skip

[show] ;  ------------- visualization setting, for plots and terminal

verbose:	verbose mode, decide if show detialed infos

log:		log mode, decide if store detialed infos to a logger file
		Here, either leave blanket to skip, or give a filename

showmode:	how to deal with figures:
		- 1. no plot
		- 2. plot what you want, however not show, but circulate to users via email/SMS/slack
		- 3. plot and show all figures together at the end
		- 4. plot and pause whenever a figure is done
		- 5. interactive mode, will enable user to change plots

showmap:	define which plots to show: 
		options: 
		- 1. 2d sky with trigger contours if any (figrue 1); 
		- 2. all galaxies (figure 1); 
		- 3. selected galaxies (figure 1);
		- 4. galaxy distance distribution (figure 2); 
		- 5. galaxy luminosity distribution (figure 3); 
		- 6. cumulative galaxy score distribution (figure 4)
		- 7. all telescope tilings (figure 1)
		- 8. selected telescope tilings (figure 1);
		- 9. route for scheduled tilings (figure 1);
		- 10. cumulative tiling score (figure 5)

[email] ;  ------------- email setting

activate:	if send email or not

email:		set email sender account
		leave blanket if activate False

emailpass:	set email sender password
		leave blanket if activate False

emailsmtp:	set email sender host and port
		leave blanket if activate False

emailto:	set email receiver account
		leave blanket if activate False

emailsub:	
		set email subject
		leave blanket if activate False

[phone] ;  ------------- phone message setting, by using Twilio

activate:	if send SMS or not

account:	set twilio account
		leave blanket if activate False

token:		set twilio token
		leave blanket if activate False

to:		set SMS receiver
		leave blanket if activate False

from:		set SMS sender
		leave blanket if activate False

[slack] ;-------------- define slack configuration

activate:	if send slack or not

token:		set slack token
		leave blanket if activate False

botid:		set slack bot id
		leave blanket if activate False

channel:	
		set slack channel to receive msg
		leave blanket if activate False
