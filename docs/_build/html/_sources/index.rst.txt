Welcome to the pstools documentation
=====================================

`Pointing Scheduler Tools (PSTools) <https://sngyang.com/pstools>`_ is a Python package to help develop observing strategies for astronomical telescopes.

`pstools` provides utilities to:

* handle and evaluate trigger (e.g. GW, GRB, or AMON) map via `Healpy/HEALPix <https://healpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_.
* generate pointing list for specific telescope, depending on its searching strategy, i.e. tiling or galaxy monitoring search.
* optimize observing strategy in order to effectively cover trigger volume, with inclusion of visibility, and the detection efficiency.
* visualize the above process, circulate to users via various of approaches.
